\textbf{Abstract:}\\

In this final degree project, several CC1350 microcontroller are used to create a wireless network operating in the 868 MHz band. These microcontrollers can additionally broadcast Bluetooth Low Energy advertisement packets, thus allowing the interaction with mobile hand-held devices usign web technology. This communication paradigm is known as the physical web.\\

In addition to the deployment of the wireless network, a web service has been built in order to monitor and manage it. The web service consists of a back-end module based on NodeJS and a front-end application developed with AngularjS.\\

In order to verifty the performance of the platform, a test application with two different nodes has been created. One of the nodes  sends packets from the physical web and the other one is responsible for simulating a public bicycle parking.
